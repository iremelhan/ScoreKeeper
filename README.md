# ScoreKeeper

In this project, I use DOM manipulation content, events and working with events. Also, I use HTML and basic CSS. I create ping pong score keeping using all of them. In buttons, I use different CSS framework, not bootstrap, but another similar tool called is BULMA. I select or change the numbers using JavaScript. I create buttons and headings using HTML.
